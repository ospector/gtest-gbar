#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =
This project is an independent addition for [http://code.google.com/p/googletest/ googletest].

 
Google Test is an excellent xUnit style c++ unit testing framework. It is highly recommended. One (minor) drawback of Google Test is it's text based UI, and this project attempts to help.

= Deliverables =
This project is a standalone .Net 2.0 executable which displays a UI for a Google Test based harness with the following elements:
  # A progress bar which is either green or red, according to test success
  # A list of all failures and their details upon click

= Installation =
TBD

= FAQ =
== Why isn't this a plug-in for my favorite IDE ==
I didn't want to bother writing several plug-in's. Actually I sisn;t even want to write one. I find that a standalone app that I run constantly as I code is very convenient, and I am not limited to VS 2005/2008/2010, Eclipse, etc.
== So how do you recommend I use this ==
  # Fire up your IDE
  # Run the app (called "Guitar" - you can work out the acronym)
  # In app main dialog select your test executable
  # Press "Go" whenever your tests/code compile (TDDers, note the order ;-) )

Enjoy.

Omri.
